      <p>
        Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that enables developers to execute
        JavaScript code on the server side, rather than in a web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was introduced in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, revolutionizing web development
        by allowing JavaScript to be used for full-stack development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Node.js is built on Googleâ€™s V8 engine, known for its speed and
        efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        It follows an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it
        lightweight and perfect for building scalable network applications like
        web servers, APIs, and microservices.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a large ecosystem of libraries and tools available via npm (Node
        Package Manager), Node.js simplifies building server-side applications
        and can handle many connections simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's especially popular for real-time applications like chat apps,
        live-streaming services, and collaborative tools.
